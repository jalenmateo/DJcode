# Active Context: DJcode Compiler (Initialization)

## Current Focus
-   Initializing the project structure and Memory Bank.
-   Defining the initial scope and goals based on the user request.
-   Planning the structure and functionality of the `WAVGenerator.c` component.

## Recent Changes
-   Created core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
-   Created `WAVGenerator.h` defining the WAV generator interface.
-   Created `WAVGenerator.c` with initial implementation based on the example.

## Next Steps
1.  Implement specific sound generation functions (`addBoom`, `addTsss`, etc.) in `WAVGenerator.c`.
2.  Define the DJcode language syntax and keywords more formally.
3.  Start implementing the Lexer (`lexer.c`).
4.  Create the `Makefile`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The core WAV generation logic will be adapted from the user-provided C example.
-   Need to define how keywords like "boom", "tsss" translate into specific sound generation parameters (frequency, duration, waveform, envelope). This will likely involve pre-defined sound profiles within `WAVGenerator.c` or a related configuration.
