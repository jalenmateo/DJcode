# Project Brief: DJcode Compiler

## Core Goal
Develop a compiler in C that translates a simple, natural-language-like esoteric programming language called "DJcode" into standard WAV audio files.

## Key Features
-   **Input:** DJcode source files (`.txt` or `.dj`).
-   **Processing:** Lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and WAV generation.
-   **Output:** A `.wav` audio file representing the musical sequence described in the DJcode.
-   **Language Keywords:** Utilize intuitive words like "boom", "tsss", "bang" to represent specific sounds or musical events.
-   **Target Use Case:** Easily generate WAV samples for music production, particularly beats.
