# Progress: DJcode Compiler (WAV Generator Setup)

## What Works
-   Project concept defined.
-   Initial Memory Bank structure created (`memory-bank/`).
-   WAV Generator interface defined (`WAVGenerator.h`).
-   Sound synthesis module created (`soundwaves.h/c`) with all required sounds:
    * DRUM: BOOM, TSST, CLAP, CRASH, REST, DUN
    * TRIANGLE: DING, DIDING, DIDIDING
-   Test pattern implemented in `WAVGenerator.c` to demonstrate all sounds.

## What's Left to Build
-   DJcode language specification (detailed keyword definitions, syntax).
-   Lexer implementation (`lexer.c`).
-   Parser implementation (`parser.c`).
-   Semantic Analyzer implementation (`semantic.c`).
-   Main compiler driver (`compiler.c`).
-   Makefile.
-   README documentation.
-   Example DJcode files.

## Current Status
-   Sound synthesis implementation complete.
-   Ready for testing and refinement of generated sounds.
-   Can proceed with lexer/parser development once sound quality is verified.

## Known Issues
-   Generated sounds need testing to verify quality and distinctness.
-   May need frequency/envelope adjustments based on testing.
